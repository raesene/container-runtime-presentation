# Fistful of container runtimes - 2018

Presentation on Container runtimes for the Cloud Native Meetup in Glasgow - August 2018

# Abstract

A couple of years ago the Docker container runtime was the main way to execute application containers on Linux, but since then a number of alternatives have emerged on Linux and Windows, offering a variety of options for getting containers running and promising enhanced security to get round the bogeyman of "containers don't contain".

This talk will look at some of the details of how Docker works and the alternatives that are emerging including gVisor, Kata Containers and options for running containers on Windows.
